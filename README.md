Project Started: August 2025
# 🎓 SyllaSmart (Prototype)

**SyllaSmart** is an AI-assisted web app designed to help college students organize their class syllabus into an easily-readable schedule. The system uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to extract tasks from uploaded syllabi. This will automatically build a calendar that can be viewed from a monthly, weekly, daily and list perspective. Extracted events are rated by standard course level and type to adjust time priority.
