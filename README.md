Project Started: August 2025
# 🎓 SyllaSmart (Prototype)

**SyllaSmart** is a front-end–focused AI-assisted web app designed to help college students organize syllabus into a easily-readable schedule. The system uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to extract tasks from uploaded syllabi. This will automatically build a calendar that can be viewed from a monthly, weekly, daily and list perspective. The user can prioritize study sessions to improve academic success through our difficulty scaling system.
